Serendipity is a service that pings you when your friends have checkedin near 
you using Facebook places.

The client uses background location to keep the server up to date with your
current location.  The server constantly polls facebook to see if any of your
friends have logged in nearby.

This app was made so I could try out pylons and learn about the facebook
graph api.
